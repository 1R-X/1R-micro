# 1R-Micro – Project Status Summary (as of May 2025)

## ✅ Status Summary

The 1R-Micro project has reached a stable and functional baseline. It now delivers a minimal, embeddable, and federated semantic object server built in Python, with all core features in place and a foundation for growth.

---

## 📦 Key Deliverables Completed

### 🔧 Core Features

* **Modular architecture** with `micro_core/` for logic, `server.py` for entry point
* **Full REST API** supporting:

  * `GET /objects`, `GET /objects/<id>`
  * `POST /objects`, `PUT /objects/<id>`, `DELETE /objects/<id>`
* **JSON-LD object handling** with normalized `@id` generation
* **File-based object store** in `object_store/`
* **Environment-configurable settings** via `config.yaml`

  * Custom `store_path`, `base_uri`, `default_context`

### 🧪 Tests

* `tests/test_api.py` to validate endpoint behavior
* `tests/test_store.py` to validate datastore logic independently

### 🔄 Federation

* `peers.yaml` defines known peers
* `sync.py` enables:

  * `pull_from_peer(peer_url)` and `push_to_peer(peer_url)`
  * `pull_all()` and `push_all()` across configured peers
* Tested multi-node setup with custom config and port separation

### 📁 Repo Organization

* `examples/` for future sample data
* `docs/architecture.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `README.md`
* Clean `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and structure suitable for growth

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 🔧 Stability and Developer Tools

* Add `sync_cli.py` to trigger push/pull from terminal easily
* Add `Makefile` with common commands (`run`, `test`, `sync`)
* Add Docker support for multi-node testing

### 🧠 Semantic Enrichment

* Introduce basic schema validation using `jsonschema`
* Begin building vocabularies in `shared-schemas/`
* Index by `@type` or `@context` for basic querying

### 🌐 Federation Enhancements

* Add support for webhook-style pub-sub notifications
* Track object origin/source (e.g. `_source`, `_created` fields)
* Prevent duplicate `@id` conflicts with a digest/checksum approach

### 🧪 Usability and Testing

* Add `examples/shipment.json` and other ready-made JSON-LD templates
* Implement visual object viewer in `micro_ui/`
* Expand test coverage for federation and CLI

### 📣 Community Readiness

* Draft `roadmap.md`
* Create GitHub issue templates
* Write launch blog post or video intro

## 🧭 Vision Reminder

1R-Micro is the foundation of the 1R-X ecosystem: a lightweight, federated, and semantic approach to recording real-world data. It is meant to run anywhere, talk to anything, and enable responsible, open data infrastructure.

**Status: ✅ Core Complete | 🔄 Federation Active | 🚀 Ready to Expand**
