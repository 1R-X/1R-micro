# 1R-Micro – Project Status Summary (as of May 2025)

## ✅ Status Summary

The 1R-Micro project has reached a robust and usable foundation. It delivers a minimal, embeddable, and federated semantic object server with multi-entity access control, event-driven extensions, and a developer-friendly REST API. A browser-based test UI and local webhook handler are now included.

---

## 📦 Key Deliverables Completed

### 🔧 Core Features

* **Modular architecture** with `micro_core/` for logic, `server.py` for entry point

* **Full REST API** with versioning (`/v1/`) supporting:

  * `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` on `/v1/objects`
  * `GET /v1/objects/<id>/render` for Markdown/HTML/ASCII views

* **JSON-LD object support** with:

  * Normalized `@id` generation (`urn:1r-micro:<uuid>`)
  * `@context`, `@type`, `linkedTo`, and custom fields

* **Field-level access control**:

  * Redaction via `_privateFields`
  * Visibility (`public`, `sharedWith`)
  * Entity-matching via simulated bearer token

* **Static frontend UI** (`/frontend`) with interactive browser testing

* **Simple simulated token system** via `Authorization: Bearer <entity>`

---

### 🪝 Events & Pub/Sub

* `POST /v1/events` for domain events referencing objects
* `POST /v1/subscriptions` to register filters and event types
* `GET /v1/subscriptions` to list subscriptions
* `DELETE /v1/subscriptions/<id>` to remove them
* **Webhook delivery**:

  * Local `/webhook` endpoint built in for testing
  * Filtered events trigger matching subscriptions automatically

---

### 🧪 Testing & Dev Tools

* Local browser testing via frontend + DevTools
* `utils.py` for redaction, auth, rendering, and pub/sub utilities
* `datastore.py` includes read/write for objects, events, and subscriptions
* `config.yaml` supports custom store path and base URI
* `openapi.json` auto-generated for schema-aware tooling

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 🛠️ Developer Tools

* Add `Makefile` with `run`, `test`, `sync`, `reset`
* CLI support to `post`, `get`, `subscribe`, and `push/pull`
* Browser-based event log viewer

### 🧠 Semantic & Ontology

* Add lightweight schema validation (e.g., `jsonschema`, `shacl-lite`)
* Support redaction rules based on object types / ontology
* Define standard object vocabularies for test domains (logistics, sensors, notes)

### 🌐 Federation & Sync

* Peer syncing with digest-based deduplication
* Expose `/v1/peers` for peer introspection
* Add webhook chaining between nodes (relay mode)

### 🧪 Usability & Community

* Add developer sandbox instructions
* Dockerfile for isolated multi-node tests
* Launch blog post or explainer video
* Community site at `1r.tools` with examples and docs

---

## 🧭 Vision Reminder

1R-Micro is the semantic core of the 1R-X ecosystem: lightweight, federated, and designed for responsible data sharing. It enables experimentation, prototyping, and deployment of object-centric, linked data systems — on edge devices, in local apps, or across global networks.

**Status: ✅ Core Complete | 🔁 Events Working | 🌐 Federation Emerging | 🚀 Ready to Grow**
