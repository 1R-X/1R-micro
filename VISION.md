# Vision: Evolving ONE Record into a Universal Data Infrastructure

**1R-Micro** is the foundation of a cross-domain, federated object system built on ONE Record principles. It enables structured, linked, and meaningful data exchange across sectors — not just in aviation.

By making ONE Record lightweight, embeddable, and domain-neutral, we’ve unlocked new applications in logistics, IoT, environmental sensing, research, and beyond.

## 🧭 Strategic Direction

We believe the time has come to extend ONE Record beyond aviation and evolve it into a foundational framework for data orchestration across domains. From smart manufacturing to healthcare, from IoT devices to media asset management, ONE Record’s architecture can be adapted to serve as the universal data interchange protocol of the physical and digital world.

## 🧩 Core Evolution Concepts

1. **1R-Micro** – A minimal, embeddable reference implementation for rapid prototyping, education, and low-resource deployment
2. **1R-Sync** – A federated synchronization engine supporting offline-first operation, versioning, and peer-to-peer sharing
3. **Meta-1R** – Decouples the air cargo ontology, enabling domain-specific extensions through reusable vocabularies and shared contexts
4. **1R-GraphView** – A universal, interactive graph viewer for linked object exploration and timeline navigation
5. *(Future)* **1R-AI** – Transforms linked data into formats ready for AI querying and explainability
6. *(Future)* **1R-Certify** – Adds digital signatures, tamper evidence, and blockchain anchoring for high-assurance workflows

## 🚀 Achievements So Far

- ✅ Fully working JSON-LD-native object server
- ✅ Event model with domain events and webhook delivery
- ✅ Fine-grained access control with simulated tokens
- ✅ Human-readable rendering endpoints (`/render`)
- ✅ Minimal UI for interacting and testing with data
- ✅ Foundation for federation and sync via peer configuration

---

## 🎯 Strategic Goals

- Establish ONE Record as a **domain-neutral data orchestration framework**
- Build **open-source reference implementations** for Micro, Meta, and Embedded use cases
- Engage **cross-sector partners** in logistics, health, climate, media, and research
- Anchor governance in a **neutral standards body** (e.g. W3C, OLF, Eclipse)
- Publish a **community roadmap** and support extensions

## 🤝 Call to Action

We invite technologists, domain experts, and standards bodies to collaborate on extending ONE Record into a cross-domain open standard. Let’s build a semantic infrastructure for the real world—trusted, transparent, and interconnected.

**Build small. Connect big.**
