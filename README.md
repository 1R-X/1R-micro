Here is a cleaned and updated version of your **top-level `README.md`** for the `1R-micro` repository. It focuses on the *general architecture and vision*, removes Python-specific setup, and links to implementation subfolders when needed:

# 1R-Micro

**A minimal, embeddable, federated object engine for semantic data exchange.**

1R-Micro is the core reference implementation of the **1R-X ecosystem** — a lightweight, modular, and extensible framework for creating, linking, and exchanging semantically meaningful objects using JSON-LD.

It is **not a platform** — it is a toolkit. You can run it anywhere, embed it in your own applications, fork it to suit your use case, or connect it to peers to create a federated network of semantic object servers.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🧠 **Semantic-first**: Native JSON-LD support with `@id`, `@type`, and `@context`
* 🔗 **Linked data model**: Create meaningful relationships across distributed objects
* 🌐 **Federation-ready**: Sync data across nodes via pull, push, or pub/sub
* ⚙️ **Pluggable backends**: File store by default, database or IPFS possible
* 🌍 **Domain-neutral**: Works across logistics, environment, research, IoT, etc.
* 📦 **Embeddable**: Runs in edge devices, laptops, or cloud containers

## 🧱 Core Concepts

### 🔹 Semantic Objects

Every object in 1R-Micro is a JSON-LD document with a unique `@id`. These objects can represent real-world entities like shipments, sensors, packages, or people — or abstract ones like tasks, events, and processes.

### 🔹 Object Store

Objects are stored locally (as flat files or in a backend of your choice) and exposed via a REST interface. They can be listed, retrieved, created, updated, deleted, and linked.

### 🔹 Federation

1R-Micro supports multi-node synchronization through peer configuration, webhook subscriptions, and event relays — enabling decentralized data ecosystems.

### 🔹 Extensibility

Each deployment can define its own schemas, contexts, and types. You can integrate with external services, sign objects, or build full applications on top using SDKs or the 1R-UI.

## 🧩 Implementations

This repository hosts the **official reference implementation**:

### 🐍 [`/1R-micro-python`](./1R-micro-python)

* Python + Flask
* Flat file-based object store
* REST API for CRUD, events, subscriptions, federation
* Includes a simple in-browser frontend test app

> See [`1R-micro-python/README.md`](./1R-micro-python/README.md) for usage and developer instructions.

---

## 📡 Roadmap Highlights

Planned and ongoing enhancements:

* ✅ Event & pub/sub model (`/events`, `/subscriptions`)
* 🔄 Federation CLI & peer pull/push
* 🔗 Webhook chaining across nodes
* 🔍 Graph and relationship viewer (via 1R-UI)
* 🧠 Schema validation and ontology support
* 📦 Docker + Dev sandbox tooling

---

## 🧠 Why 1R-Micro?

The modern world is built on data. But most systems focus on *syntax* — not *meaning*. 1R-Micro flips that: it prioritizes semantics, identity, and interoperability from the start.

It’s small enough to run anywhere. And open enough to connect everything.
